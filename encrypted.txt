LIFE IS ALL ABOUT YOU AND NOT AT ALL ABOUT YOU
NOW, THAT'S TWO OPPOSING THOUGHTS AND YET BOTH OF THEM ARE TRUE
HOW CAN YOU EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING YOU CHOOSE TO DO
WHILE OBSERVING THE EXPERIENCE YOU'RE HAVING FROM A HIGHER VIEW
SEE, IT'S THE QUESTION, NOT THE ANSWER, THAT'S THE HIGHER VIEW
OTHERWISE, YOU COULDN'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO
AWARENESS? BUT OF WHO?
YOU THINK YOU HURT ME, BUT I PROMISE I WAS LETTING YOU
THEY SAY WE'RE ALL ONE, BUT WHERE HAVE WE BEEN HEADED TO
I'D RATHER DIE FREE THAN HAVE TO LIVE INSIDE A PETTING ZOO
I AM THE JOURNEY THAT I'M GETTING TO
