# Enigma
Mimics the enigma machine that Alan Turing was able to crack.

## Self Assessment

### Functionality

> 3.0 Encrypt and Decrypt functionality are working as required

### Object Oriented Programming

> 4.0 Successfully implemented shiftable module that contains methods that are utilized by both the Encrypting and Decrypting classes.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

> 3.5 Classes, methods, and variables do have descriptive names. Code is made with the reader in mind. Most efficient enumerables are used whenever possible.

### Test Driven Development

> 3.5 Reaches 100% coverage as reported by simplecov. Stubs are used when needed, and provide more robust coverage for testing.

### Version Control

> 3.5 Over 50 commits. Clear commit messages and pull request messages. Most commits cover a clear area of functionality.

## Information Flow 

> Use this directory to encrypt and decrypt files similar to the ones that Alan Turing cracked! This flowchart shows how information comes in through our runner files, goes our enigma hub class, passes through encrypting or decrypting classes, and uses the shiftable module to create the encrypted and decrypted files.
